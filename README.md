## Frontend Challenge
Solved by: Angel Mateo Gonzalez Bejarano | 2023

### Used tools
Hi there!
For this challenge I used the following tools to create the app:

1. React.js
2. Redux (for state management)
3. TailwindCSS (for styles)
4. Json Server (to provide some mock data)

### Known issues

For me, was a little bit challenge to implement the infinite scrolling because I prefer over than pagination.
Also was a little bit tricky to work with the newest version of Next.js and Redux.
